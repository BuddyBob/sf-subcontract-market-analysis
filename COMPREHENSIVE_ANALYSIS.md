# 2020 Pre-Bid Data Analysis - Comprehensive Market Concentration Study

This analysis reveals **significant market concentration** in San Francisco's construction subcontracting market. After correcting for artificially fragmented scope definitions, **95.7% of trade categories remain highly concentrated**, indicating systemic competition problems that require immediate regulatory attention.

### **Key Findings**:
- **$237.9 million** in subcontractor spending across 141 meaningful trade categories
- **Only 1 out of 141 markets** shows true competition (Trucking & Hauling)
- **5 markets** show moderate concentration with viable competition
- **135 markets** remain highly concentrated despite scope consolidation

---

## **Consolidation**

The original data contained 257  fragmented scopes that created misleading "monopolies." For example:
- "AC Paving"
- "AC paving" 
- "AC Paving & Concrete flatwork"
- "AC Paving, Sawcutting, Traffic"
- "AC panel/asphalt pave"

Possibly by mistake but this could create misleading impressions of market competition when a company controls multiple related scopes.

### **Solution Applied**:
Consolidated related scopes using keyword:
- **Before**: 99.6% concentration (artificially inflated)
- **After**: 95.7% concentration (realistic but still severe)


## **Market Concentration Analysis**

#### Competitive Markets (1 scope):
- **Trucking & Hauling**: $6.4M market, 15 competitors, HHI: 1,174
  - **Top Player**: Camajani Trucking (21.5% share)
  - **Market Structure**: Well-distributed competition, no dominant player

#### Moderately Concentrated Markets (5 scopes):

3. **Engineering & Design Services**: $5.9M, 9 competitors, HHI: 1,888
4. **Concrete Work**: $31.0M, 17 competitors, HHI: 2,013
5. **Structural Work**: $9.0M, 11 competitors, HHI: 2,270

#### Highly Concentrated Markets (135 scopes):
The remaining 135 markets show severe concentration
